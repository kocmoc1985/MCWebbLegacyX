    <h3>MCBrowser</h3>
    <p>MixCont Browser (MCBrowser) is MixCont on-line and off-line viewer for monitoring and analysing of relevant mixing process related data including: all the available sensor signals, process and control parameters, raw materials and weighing data, laboratory test results and etceteras. The data content can be tailored on customer’s demand during the installation and operation of the MCBrowser. The data can be presented graphically and/or in form of numerous preformatted display pages. Printable reports are available.</p>  

    <p>All the sensor signals and other relevant process data are recorded and stored ones per second.</p>

    <p>Stored data is batch-related, compressed and archived on MixCont server. So data for the last 5-10 years is instantly available for analyses.</p>

    <p>MCBrowser makes the data accessible from the customer’s enterprise network or by the use of Internet connection</p>

    <p class="underline">Online Monitoring and analysing </p>
    <p>MixCont viewer allows on-line graphical visualisation of any combination of measured signals in one chart. The chart is refreshed once per sec. It enables to follow behaviour of every signal and interaction between the signals while the mixing is running.</p>
    <p>Batch-related process parameters are displayed in tables simultaneously with the chart of the signals or separately.</p>

    <p class="underline">Off-line monitoring and analysing</p>
    <p>MixCont viewer displays any combination of graphs of measured signals related to the batch in one chart. It gives possibility to analyse behaviour of different signals separately and in interaction.</p>
    <p>Batch related data like process and control parameters, raw materials and weighing data, laboratory test results and etceteras can be selected and displayed separately or simultaneously with the chart of the signals. Possibility to see the entire batch related data in one screen helps the user to identify cause-and-effect relationships and solve problems.</p>

    <p class="underline">Mixing data related to several batches</p>
    <p>On the user’s request MCBrowser displays any combination of graphs of measured signals related to several batches in one chart or in several charts in one screen. It allows easy comparison between the mixing behaviour of different batches.</p>
    <p>All the signals are automatically scaled on the y-axis. Scaling on x-axis can be automatic or manual on the user’s request.</p>
    <p>To see the displayed graphs in more details Zoom function can be used or the graphs can be shifted to the right/left side.</p>
    <p>MixCont viewer also enables to read values of the displayed signals at any point of the graph.</p>
    <p>Measured signals corresponding to one batch or several batches can be exported into Excel in numerical form.</p>
    <p>MCBrowser has a user friendly environment. Its design and layout of the records can be tailored to meet specific user requirements.</p>
