    <p>MC Lab automatically collects and processes laboratory test results from testing instruments and manually entered data. The instruments can be of any producer, type and age. They can be connected to MC Lab directly, via file exchange or custom interface.</p>
    <p>For every instrument MCLab displays test procedure, test limits, comments of the laboratory technician, test results, test validation (Pass/Fail) etc. The validation is made automatically. For instruments that present graphics MC Lab provides simultaneous visualisation of the curves and numerical results. To simplify comparison of test curves related to several batches, MC Lab allows superposition of the curves in one chart.</p>
    <p>MCLab has an interface to import production plan and correspondent test profiles from different kind of administrative systems. Test parameters are automatically downloaded to the instruments from test profiles. Easy to use interface module is designed to edit test profiles, test parameters, test limits etc. </p>
    <p>Statistic trend curves and histograms are available for all the numerical test results. Specially developed fast search engine enables to plot trend curves corresponding to a set of test data for a period of ten years within few seconds. MC Lab makes comprehensive real time statistical analyses and provides data interface for analysis to MCExcel and specialised analytical software like MatLab, Diadem, etc.</p>
