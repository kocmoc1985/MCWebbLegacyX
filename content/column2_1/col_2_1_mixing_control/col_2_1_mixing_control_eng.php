    <h3>What MixCont control system does?</h3>
    <p>MixCont mixing control system makes on-line automatic adjustments to batches properties as they evolve while the mixing is running. The adjustments are based on:</p>  
    <ol>
        <li>intelligence gathered during the mixing of previous batches 
        <li>automatic investigating of mixing data collected in MixCont data base 
        <li>on-line estimation of the compounds' properties evolution made by analyses of correlation among the critical variables that affect compound quality 
    </ol>
    <p>It enables to adjust final properties of compounds automatically, overcome feasible variations in properties of ingredients, mixing conditions and other process disturbances, manage event exceptions preventing quality defects and turn problem batches into acceptable ones. As the result compounds properties become automatically controllable & much more uniform. Scrap rate and compounds’ rework decreases dramatically. Greater quality allows skipping lot testing reducing test expenditures. Linkage of mentioned on-line & off-line technologies enables MixCont control system to identify the process optimum. It results in minimized time required to achieve desirable quality of compounds. It delivers essential time & energy savings. Profitability and reliability of mixing process essentially improves. </p>

    <h3>MixCont uses advanced, proven technologies</h3>
    <p>MixCont process control technology builds upon software and algorithm development since the mid-‘80s. Core of MixCont adaptive, self-learning, real-time process control is model of non-stationary mixing process. It is designed for real time estimation of the mixing process behaviour and compound properties that are described by the set of functional derived from the physical parameters received from the process in form of output signals - fingerprints (process cardiograms!). </p>
    
    <p>Core of the model is based on theory of electric drive and thermodynamic model of the compound behaviour. The fussy logic algorithms as formalisation of integral processing experience are used to approximate theoretical model to reality. The model applies on-line signal processing techniques for non-stationary processes:</p>
    
    <ol>
        <li>techniques similar to FFT analysis, but for non-stationary conditions frequency and time domain 
        <li>auto/cross-correlation algorithms for analogue variables that affect compound quality (temperatures, torque & etceteras) and various digital signals. 
        <li>Order analysis 
        <li>Statistical classification techniques (single/rain flow) 
        <li>Various algorithms for signals data smoothing, filtering and extrapolation 
        <li>For on-line optimisation of decision making the model applies various 
    </ol>
    <p>optimisation techniques and approaches namely Pareto classification in combination to nonlinear optimisation based on non stationary presentation of the process - model similar to semi-markovian stochastic process and optimisation of such a processes by dynamic programming method.
