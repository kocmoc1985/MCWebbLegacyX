    <h3>MCStats</h3>
    <p>MCStats collects and collates the information systematizing it, picking up all the essentialities, defining cause-and-effect relationships, drawing conclusions and presents the results in a friendly and easy-to-use form. The tool gives detailed picture of the equipment use, time and human resources, defines and informs about the issues affecting the quality and productivity as they happen, makes early detection and notification about malfunctions, promotes process understanding. It enables to get more out of the existing resources to make the production more profitable, reliable and friendly to the environment. MCDetector detects and informs about issues negatively affecting quality of the compounds and/or productivity of the mixing line as they happen, defines causes for problems, shows influence of the problems on the quality and productivity.
