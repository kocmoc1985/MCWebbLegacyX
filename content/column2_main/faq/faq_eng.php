    <p class='bold'>How does MixCont differ from other mixing control systems?</p>
    <p>The MixCont system is unique due to its ability to analyze a compound’s properties and optimize the mixing process while the compound is being mixed in the mixer.  (No other industrial control system that has this capability.)</p>
</div>

<div class="column_2_article">
    <p class='bold'>How does MixCont work?</p>
    <p>MixCont uses sensors to receive information from the various components of the mixer.  This provides the MixCont algorithm with inputs such as: torque, power, temperature, ram position and pressure, as well as rotor speed.  Based on the user’s objectives, the algorithm then updates the mixer’s control parameters in real time to obtain the compound’s desired properties for each batch using minimum time and energy.  The Mixcont system allows the user to prioritize objectives (productivity versus quality) for each compound.</p>
</div>

<div class="column_2_article">
    <p class='bold'>How does MixCont estimate the properties of a compound?</p>
    <p>MixCont follows the same principle as an Oscillating Disk Rheometer (ODR).  The system estimates the properties using the mixer itself instead of torque rheometry.  It uses the torque value from the mixer’s rotor in combination with temperature, pressure and other signals to build the internal MixCont quality parameters.  These quality parameters correlate to the level of distribution, dispersion and viscosity and are used for control optimization.  MixCont uses these parameters to achieve user designated uniform batch to batch properties.</p>
</div>

<div class="column_2_article">
    <p class='bold'>Are there mixer compatibility issues with MixCont?</p>
    <p>No.  MixCont works with every age and size mixer from the lab to large production models.  Additionally, the system is compatible with tangential, intermix and variable rotor clearance mixers.  MixCont provides gains for any mixer where it is installed.</p>
</div>

<div class="column_2_article">
    <p class='bold'>Are there any compound limitations with MixCont?</p>
    <p>MixCont will work with any plastic or rubber compound. Additionally, the system has been tested on non-polymer compounds in processes such as baking, concrete mixing and oil refining.  The system is effective in any mixing process of unique ingredients.</p>
</div>

<div class="column_2_article">
    <p class='bold'>The advantages of MixCont over a traditional recipe-based mixing systems.</p>
    <p>Based on customer feedback, MixCont will deliver energy and time savings of 5 to 20%.  Simultaneously with those savings, viscosity becomes controllable, batch to batch uniformity is improved resulting in fewer processing adjustments, and heat build-up becomes uniform during molding of the end product. Installation reports are available by request for your review.</p>
</div>

<div class="column_2_article">
    <p class='bold'>What other information does MixCont provide to the process engineer?</p>
    <p>MixCont uses built-in analysis tools to optimize all aspects of the mixing process.  The process engineer can use these tools in virtually limitless ways for insight into the entire mixing process including malfunction notification.</p>
</div>

<div class="column_2_article">
    <p class='bold'>How does MixCont set optimization criteria?</p>
    <p>MixCont is a self-learning system.  The system identifies mixing process behavior and compares the current batch with all previous batches in terms of distribution, dispersion and viscosity.  The system learns from each batch and achieves better results on every subsequent batch until the point where quality parameters cannot be improved further within the given mixing time limits or the mixing time cannot be reduced to achieve the desired quality parameters.  The process will then be stabilized and any mixing changes will only be due to ongoing processing and raw material variations.</p>
</div>

<div class="column_2_article">
    <p class='bold'>How does the MixCont system integrate into my process?</p>
    <p>Additionally, the system works in parallel with the existing control system and only assumes control of the process’ mixing stage.  By design, MixCont does not control the mixer’s devices directly, but integrates with the current control system.  The alarm, communication and other auxiliary functions continue to be carried out by the existing control system, so the integrity of the entire mixing system remains intact.  Additionally, installing MixCont does not require stopping production.</p>
</div>

<div class="column_2_article">    
    <p class='bold'>How does MixCont take advantage of replacing AC drives with DC drives?</p>
    <p>MixCont is probably the only system that can fully use the great potential of transitioning to DC drives.  Because the system uses “on the fly” variable speed changes to improve the mixing process, it is a complementary technology for MixCont.</p>
</div>

<div class="column_2_article">    
    <p class='bold'>Does MixCont give me the capability to remotely track my process?</p>
    <p>Yes, you can access your MixCont system information via your corporate intranet.  Internet access may become available as an option.</p>
</div>

<div class="column_2_article"> 
    <p class='bold'>Does MixCont simplify the work of the process engineer?</p>
    <p>Because MixCont automates the mixing process the process engineer is free to focus on higher priority projects, increasing his productivity.  No longer is an engineer “tied” to the mixer to prevent out of control processes.</p>
</div>

<div class="column_2_article"> 
    <p class='bold'>How does MixCont ease implementing a new compound into production?</p>
    <p>The MixCont user has already established a mixing profile for all of his compounds which includes all of the best practices he has developed.  MixCont will integrate its knowledge of the compounding process, local machinery and raw materials with the new recipe and adjust accordingly.  Therefore, the time required to bring a new compound into production is dramatically reduced.  Additionally, by storing this mixing knowledge and transferring it electronically, the user is able to transfer mixing processes overseas without spending extra time relearning mixing techniques specific for that compound.</p>
