    <p>The installation process is very simple and consists of 3 easy steps</p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href='http://www.mixcont.com/_files/_upload/jre-7u40-windows-i586.exe'>Download</a> and install Java
            if you don't have Java or the version is older than <strong>7</strong></li>
        <li>Get your MixCont programs installer from <a href="http://www.mixcont.com/_files/_support/for_all/MCLauncher.exe" style="text-decoration: underline">here.</a>

        <li>Run the installation file. After the installation is finished
            run the program <i>(the shortcut "yellow arrow" can be found on the desktop)</i>. It may take a few minutes for the program to download all needed files.</li>
    </ul>

    <p style="font-size: 8pt">* Note! the MixCont installation program does not connect to the Internet, all programs are
        acquired from the MixCont sever deployed in you corporate network if any.
